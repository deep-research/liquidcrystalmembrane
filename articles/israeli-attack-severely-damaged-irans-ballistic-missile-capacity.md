Reuters confirmed last night that Iran's ability to continue and develop special fuel for the missiles has been significantly damaged. Meanwhile, senior Iranian officials told the New York Times that the attack caused great concern in Tehran about further attacks in the future. At a site in Parchin, based on an analysis by the ISIS organization, they reported that in the Israeli attack a site called "Taleghan 2" was affected, which was previously suspected of conducting experiments related to Iran's nuclear weapons program.
An expert who spoke with Reuters said that it is likely that the damage caused "will harm Iran's ability to produce advanced ballistic missiles like those used in attacks on Israel on October 1".
In satellite images published yesterday, after the Israeli attack in Iran, direct hits were seen at a secret Iranian base in Parchin, about 30 kilometers east of Tehran. In recent years, the secret Iranian base has been dubbed a "security facility", where research and development of missiles and suicide drones is conducted, among other things.
Yesterday, the Saudi site Ilaf, known as a site with good sources in Israel, reported that Israel destroyed a large number of fuel mixers, each worth at least two million dollars. Sources familiar with the Iranian missile industry told the Saudi site that it would take at least two years to restore the plant to activity.  Iran’s overall ballistic missile arsenal, which includes shorter-range missiles unable to reach Israel, was estimated to be “over 3,000” by Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, then-commander of the U.S. military’s Central Command, in testimony to the U.S. Senate in 2022. In the time since, Iran has fired hundreds of the missiles in a series of attacks.

Israel Damaged Iranian Nuclear Project base linked to Iran’s onetime nuclear weapons program
At Parchin, Albright’s Institute for Science and International Security identified the destroyed building against a mountainside as “Taleghan 2.” It said an archive of Iranian nuclear data earlier seized by Israel identified the building as housing “a smaller, elongated high explosive chamber and a flash X-ray system to examine small-scale high explosive tests.”
“Such tests may have included high explosives compressing a core of natural uranium, simulating the initiation of a nuclear explosive,” a 2018 report by the institute says. In a message posted to the social platform X early Sunday, the institute added: “It is not certain whether Iran used uranium at ‘Taleghan 2,’ but it is possible it studied the compression of natural uranium hemispheres, which would explain its hasty and secretive renovation efforts following the IAEA’s request to access Parchin in 2011.”
Israel’s strikes on Iran reportedly hit air defense systems protecting missile production, nuclear labs, and energy sites for oil rectification. Israel destroyed all S-300 missile systems purchased from Russia.
There were neither Israeli strikes on Iran’s oil production industry, nor its nuclear enrichment sites on nuclear power plants during the assault.
Iran now is not ready for war:

1.	Iran has no serious missile capability. Iran missile storages are depleted.

2.	Iran has no air defenses for their own country; especially they can’t protect Iraq where Israeli planes were shooting missiles into Iran. 

3.	 Iran can’t protect its nuclear enrichment sites. Bombing of these sites will create catastrophe. This will be equivalent of multiple dirty bombs lot worse than Chernobyl.

4.	Iran has no air defenses and bomb shelters to protect general population from massive casualties.

5.	Iran has no air defenses to protect oil production. If oil production will stop, Iranian oil export will stop and Iranian economy will collapse. This event will fell from Europe to Asia (especially China who is getting 10% of oil from Iran).

6.	All these things can create International crises which can lead out to a war or nuclear war. We will discuss this in the next article: “Possible Israeli Nuclear Encounter with Iran and Others”.
