The Houthis are threatening to attack Israeli oil and gas fields and Israeli power stations. If this attack occurs, Israel will impose a maritime blockade on Yemen and may possibly attack Iranian oil terminals, such as Khark Island, from where 90% of Iranian oil is shipped.\r\n\r\nIf the oil terminals are destroyed, the Iranian economy will collapse. In return, Iran will attempt to halt all oil and natural gas deliveries from OPEC countries, effectively cutting off up to 40% of the world's oil and 36% of natural gas consumption. This could lead to an international economic crisis and a world war that could potentially involve nuclear conflict or, at the very least, an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of Iranian nuclear facilities and their distances in kilometers from the Israeli port of Eilat:\r\n\r\n- **Bushehr**: 1250 km\r\n- **Natanz**: 1650 km\r\n- **Fordo**: 1600 km\r\n- **Tehran**: 1530 km\r\n- **Arak Heavy Water Plant**: 1550 km\r\n- **Khark Island (Oil Production Facility)**: 1410 km\r\n\r\nThe distances are shorter than the distance from Israel to Yemen, which is 2000 km, where Israel recently conducted an attack. It is very difficult to understand why Iranian rulers are initiating all these conflicts by supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, as this could lead to so many problems for them and their people.\r\n\r\n# Related Article (Russian Language)\r\n\r\n[Kamikaze boats and new missiles: Houthis expand war with Israel]\r\n(https://www.vesty.co.il/main/article/bylikwaua#autoplay)\r\n","image":null,"path":"/articles/dangers-of-island-khark-houthis-are-expanding-war-with-israel-and-are-considering-attacking-israeli-oil-and-gas-fields-and-power-stations/","category":{"title":"News","path":"/articles/categories/news/"},"tags":[{"title":"Israel Iran War","path":"/articles/tags/israel-iran-war/"}]}},"context":{}}
