Meanwhile, senior Iranian officials told the New York Times that the attack caused great concern in Tehran about further attacks in the future. At a site in Parchin, based on an analysis by the ISIS organization, they reported that in the Israeli attack a site called \"Taleghan 2\" was affected, which was previously suspected of conducting experiments related to Iran's nuclear weapons program.\r\nAn expert who spoke with Reuters said that it is likely that the damage caused \"will harm Iran's ability to produce advanced ballistic missiles like those used in attacks on Israel on October 1\".\r\nIn satellite images published yesterday, after the Israeli attack in Iran, direct hits were seen at a secret Iranian base in Parchin, about 30 kilometers east of Tehran. In recent years, the secret Iranian base has been dubbed a \"security facility\", where research and development of missiles and suicide drones is conducted, among other things.\r\nYesterday, the Saudi site Ilaf, known as a site with good sources in Israel, reported that Israel destroyed a large number of fuel mixers, each worth at least two million dollars. Sources familiar with the Iranian missile industry told the Saudi site that it would take at least two years to restore the plant to activity.  Iran’s overall ballistic missile arsenal, which includes shorter-range missiles unable to reach Israel, was estimated to be “over 3,000” by Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, then-commander of the U.S. military’s Central Command, in testimony to the U.S. Senate in 2022. In the time since, Iran has fired hundreds of the missiles in a series of attacks. \r\nhttps://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/398136\r\n\r\nIsrael Damaged Iranian Nuclear Project base linked to Iran’s onetime nuclear weapons program\r\nAt Parchin, Albright’s Institute for Science and International Security identified the destroyed building against a mountainside as “Taleghan 2.” It said an archive of Iranian nuclear data earlier seized by Israel identified the building as housing “a smaller, elongated high explosive chamber and a flash X-ray system to examine small-scale high explosive tests.”\r\n“Such tests may have included high explosives compressing a core of natural uranium, simulating the initiation of a nuclear explosive,” a 2018 report by the institute says. In a message posted to the social platform X early Sunday, the institute added: “It is not certain whether Iran used uranium at ‘Taleghan 2,’ but it is possible it studied the compression of natural uranium hemispheres, which would explain its hasty and secretive renovation efforts following the IAEA’s request to access Parchin in 2011.”\r\nIsrael’s strikes on Iran reportedly hit air defense systems protecting missile production, nuclear labs, and energy sites for oil rectification. Israel destroyed all S-300 missile systems purchased from Russia.\r\nThere were neither Israeli strikes on Iran’s oil production industry, nor its nuclear enrichment sites on nuclear power plants during the assault.\r\nIran now is not ready for war:\r\n\r\n1.\tIran has no serious missile capability. Iran missile storages are depleted.\r\n\r\n2.\tIran has no air defenses for their own country; especially they can’t protect Iraq where Israeli planes were shooting missiles into Iran. \r\n\r\n3.\t Iran can’t protect its nuclear enrichment sites. Bombing of these sites will create catastrophe. This will be equivalent of multiple dirty bombs lot worse than Chernobyl.\r\n\r\n4.\tIran has no air defenses and bomb shelters to protect general population from massive casualties.\r\n\r\n5.\tIran has no air defenses to protect oil production. If oil production will stop, Iranian oil export will stop and Iranian economy will collapse. This event will fell from Europe to Asia (especially China who is getting 10% of oil from Iran).\r\n\r\n6.\tAll these things can create International crises which can lead out to a war or nuclear war.

The following three areas could be targeted by Israel:\r\n\r\n1. Hark Island, which contains 90% of the Iranian oil industry.\r\n2. The Iranian parliamentary building.\r\n3. The top five Iranian nuclear facilities.\r\n\r\nIran has no modern air defenses or air force capable of defending against an Israeli attack. Nevertheless, Israel is currently not seeking to further escalate the conflict because they are working on completing their development of new laser weapons and air defenses. The UK is the first nation to successfully deploy laser weapons, so Israel believes it will be able to succeed in developing similar capabilities. Having such technologies would allow Israel to destroy Iranian and Hezbollah precision missiles and likely win if a war were to occur.\r\n\r\n# Related Article (Russian Language)\r\n\r\n- [Iran is trapped, and Israel is waiting for a weapon that will change the rules of the game]\r\n(https://detaly.co.il/iran-v-lovushke-a-izrail-zhdet-oruzhiya-kotoroe-izmenit-pravila-igry/)\r\n","image":null,"category":{"title":"News","path":"/articles/categories/news/"},"tags":[{"title":"Israel Iran War","path":"/articles/tags/israel-iran-war/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"74151d708f824b8accb9bd9940951a9c","title":"Dangers of Khark Island: Houthis Expand War with Israel, Threatening Israeli Oil and Gas Fields and Power Stations","path":"/articles/dangers-of-island-khark-houthis-are-expanding-war-with-israel-and-are-considering-attacking-israeli-oil-and-gas-fields-and-power-stations/","excerpt":"Israel may consider attacking Iranian oil and gas terminals, which could lead to multiple conflicts.","author":"News Psychic","date":"2024-08-20 16:00","content":"\r\nIran, via the Houthis, is using a large volume of new weaponry to attack Israel in response to the Israeli attack on Yemen. The Houthis are threatening to attack Israeli oil and gas fields and Israeli power stations. If this attack occurs, Israel will impose a maritime blockade on Yemen and may possibly attack Iranian oil terminals, such as Khark Island, from where 90% of Iranian oil is shipped.\r\n\r\nIf the oil terminals are destroyed, the Iranian economy will collapse. In return, Iran will attempt to halt all oil and natural gas deliveries from OPEC countries, effectively cutting off up to 40% of the world's oil and 36% of natural gas consumption. This could lead to an international economic crisis and a world war that could potentially involve nuclear conflict or, at the very least, an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of Iranian nuclear facilities and their distances in kilometers from the Israeli port of Eilat:\r\n\r\n- **Bushehr**: 1250 km\r\n- **Natanz**: 1650 km\r\n- **Fordo**: 1600 km\r\n- **Tehran**: 1530 km\r\n- **Arak Heavy Water Plant**: 1550 km\r\n- **Khark Island (Oil Production Facility)**: 1410 km\r\n\r\nThe distances are shorter than the distance from Israel to Yemen, which is 2000 km, where Israel recently conducted an attack. It is very difficult to understand why Iranian rulers are initiating all these conflicts by supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, as this could lead to so many problems for them and their people.\r\n\r\n# Related Article (Russian Language)\r\n\r\n[Kamikaze boats and new missiles: Houthis expand war with Israel]\r\n(https://www.vesty.co.il/main/article/bylikwaua#autoplay)\r\n","image":null,"category":{"title":"News","path":"/articles/categories/news/"},"tags":[{"title":"Israel Iran War","path":"/articles/tags/israel-iran-war/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"a217233dd3554bdf31dc5777253d4e25","title":"Israel May Preempt the Expected Iranian Response to their Assassination of Prominent Hamas and Hezbollah Leaders","path":"/articles/israel-may-preempt-the-expected-iranian-response-to-their-assassination-of-prominent-hamas-and-hezbollah-leaders/","excerpt":"The US is also boosting sea and air and ground defenses in the region to act as a deterrent against a larger regional conflict in the Middle East.
